// Here we check the following rules related to #[birds_eye] let-bindings:
//
// 1. A `#[birds_eye] let` should not appear unless the state machine is 'concurrent'.
//
// 2. A `#[birds_eye] let` should not appear in an 'init' transition.
//
// 3. A Guard statement cannot be declared in the scope of a `#[birds_eye] let`.
//
// 4. A 'requires', or any special op that might expand to a 'requires'
//    cannot be declared in the scope of a `#[birds_eye] let`.
//
// 5. A 'requires', or any special op that might expand to a 'requires'
//    cannot be sequenced after any 'assert' which is in
//    the scope of a `#[birds_eye] let`.
//
// The rationale for these rules is as follows:
//
// 1. This is self-explanatory. #[birds_eye] is a feature for tokenized state machines.
//    It only affects the token exchange functions, not the atomic transition relations.
//
// 2. We can't even access 'self' in an 'init' transition, so #[birds_eye] wouldn't
//    do anything.
//
// 3. This is a soundness issue. For the guarding rule to work, the guard has to be a
//    deterministic function of the inputs to the exchange function.
//
//    (Note: this rule may actually be stronger than necessary right now. For example,
//    in the StorageMap case, suppose we have `guard_kv(key, val)`. Then token being
//    guarded has value `val`, but it does not depend on the `key` argument.
//    This means that, in principle, we could have the key depend on a `birds_eye` value
//    as long as `val` does not. Making this distinction would require more fine-grained
//    dependency analysis.)
//
// 4. The point here is that if we have something like,
//
//         #[birds_eye] let x = foo;
//         require(e);
//
//    then `e` might depend on `x`. So when we try to output the precondition in the
//    exchange fn, we have to output the expression `let x = foo; e`.
//    But if the let-statement is a birds_eye statement, then the 'foo' would have
//    reference variables that don't exist in the input parameters to the exchange fn.
//    So we would end up generating a malformed expression.
//
// 5. Similar to (4), but here the idea is to prevent something like,
//
//         { #[birds_eye] let x = foo; assert(e); } require(e2);
//
//    In this case, `e2` can't directly refer to `x`, but this would still cause
//    problems, because we would generate a precondition like,
//
//         { let x = foo; e } ==> e2
//
//    And again, we can't put `foo` in a precondition.
//    In principle, we could leave these hypotheses out entirely (this would be sound,
//    since leaving off the hypothesis only makes the precondition harder to meet).
//    But the intent is that the preconditions should match what we do for the
//    'weak' transition relation (i.e., the formal definition of the transition
//    relation) and it seems better to optimize for meeting that goal.
//
// In summary:
//
//  * (1) and (2) are basically warnings
//  * (4) and (5) are necessary, but if they were omitted, we would probably just
//    end up with errors in type-resolution of the generated code.
//  * (3) is necessary for soundness and wouldn't be caught otherwise.
